# power_plant_photos
Simple python script to scrape GPS tags from photos to identify nearby power plants using EIA data.


Defaults to reading from the photos folder. OS X users might be interested in changing the photo_dir to their master folder in their Photo.app library. E.g. `/Users/your_name/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/`
